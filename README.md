# Fusion-of-LLE-and-stochastic-LEM-for-Persian-handwritten-digits-Recognition---Code
Hi Dudes,

"Fusion of LLE and stochastic LEM for Persian handwritten digits Recognition" is the title of one of my papers (which has been published in 
IJDAR journal). In this paper, we have been proposed two new local manifold learning methods: 
- Stochastic LEM (SLEM),
- Fusion of LLE and SLEM (FSLL).

This repository includes a brief description of these methods and their Matlab codes.
For more detailes, the researcher can reffer to the paper:
